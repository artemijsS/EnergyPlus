    "_1": "A carport with solar panels is a canopy that is used to protect cars from various weather conditions and other external factors. However, unlike conventional canopies, they have solar panels on the roof that generate electricity.",
    "_2": "Carports can provide a cost-effective way to generate electricity. By using the space above a carport for solar panels, it is possible to generate energy without taking up additional space on the ground. This can be particularly useful for business or organizations with limited space for solar panel installations.",
    "_3": "Carports also increase the convenience for parking users - the car is under a canopy, saves from rain, snow and other external factors."
